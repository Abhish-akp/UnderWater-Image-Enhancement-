# Underwater Image Enhancement

Welcome to the Underwater Image Enhancement project! This repository contains code and resources for enhancing the quality of underwater images. Underwater images often suffer from issues such as color distortion, low contrast, and blurriness due to the absorption and scattering of light in water. This project aims to address these challenges and improve the visual quality of underwater images.

## Introduction

Underwater Image Enhancement is crucial for various applications such as marine biology, underwater robotics, and underwater photography. This project implements several techniques to enhance underwater images, making them clearer and more visually appealing.

## Features

- Color correction to address color distortions.
- Contrast enhancement to improve visibility.
- Dehazing to reduce blurriness caused by water particles.
- Noise reduction to remove unwanted artifacts.
- Support for multiple image formats.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/underwater-image-enhancement.git
    cd underwater-image-enhancement
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

You can use the command line interface to enhance underwater images. Run the following command to see the available options:

```bash
python enhance.py --help
```

### Example

To enhance an image, use the following command:

```bash
python enhance.py --input path/to/your/image.jpg --output path/to/save/enhanced_image.jpg
```

### Script

You can also use the provided Python script in your own projects. Here is an example:

```python
from enhancement import enhance_image

input_image = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
output_image = "path/to/save/enhanced_image.jpg"

enhance_image(input_image, output_image)
```
